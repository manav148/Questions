**FAQ**

## FAQ: Fast answers for fast teams.

**How reliable is Momentic?**

Momentic tests are much more reliable than Playwright or Cypress tests because they are not affected by changes in the DOM.

**How fast can I build tests?**

It’s very easy to build tests using the low-code editor. You can also record your actions and turn them into a fully working automated test.

**Is there a big learning curve?**

Not even a little bit.

**Can you run against pull requests, merges, and commits?**

Yes. You can use Momentic's CLI to run tests anywhere. We support any CI provider that can run Node.js 20.

**Do you support mobile (iOS, Android) and desktop (Electron)?**

Mobile and desktop support is on our roadmap, but we don't have a specific release date yet.

**Do you support Chrome, Safari, and Firefox?**

We currently support Chromium and Chrome browsers for tests. Safari and Firefox support is on our roadmap, but we don't have a specific release date yet.
